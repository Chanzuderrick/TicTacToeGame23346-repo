Hello, this is my first java project. I hope you're familiar with the famous tictactoe game. I've used a 2D array to create the game. After running the code you'll input the number of the row and the number of the column. For example player X enters: 0 1. If any of the players wins the game then you'll be notified.

Thank you for looking at my project and this is just the start I hope to learn more and make more projects
